# Low-Level Design (LLD)

Welcome to my Low-Level Design (LLD) repository\! This repository is a collection of my solutions and implementations for various LLD problems. It's designed to be a resource for anyone looking to practice and improve their LLD skills for software engineering interviews and real-world application development.

## üöÄ Introduction

Low-Level Design is a critical aspect of software engineering that focuses on the design of individual components and modules of a system. A good LLD is essential for building scalable, maintainable, and robust software. This repository aims to provide a structured approach to learning and practicing LLD concepts.

## üìå Fundamental Concepts

Before diving into design patterns, it's important to have a strong foundation in the following concepts:

  * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:** Understanding the four pillars of OOP - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism - is crucial for LLD.
  * **SOLID Principles:** These are a set of five design principles that help in creating more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software.
      * **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
      * **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
      * **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
      * **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
      * **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Patterns

This section is dedicated to the various design patterns, categorized by their intent. Each pattern will have a dedicated folder with problems and their solutions.

### Creational Patterns

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

  * Singleton
  * Factory Method
  * Abstract Factory
  * Builder
  * Prototype

### Structural Patterns

These patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

  * Adapter
  * Bridge
  * Composite
  * Decorator
  * Facade
  * Flyweight
  * Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

  * Chain of Responsibility
  * Command
  * Interpreter
  * Iterator
  * Mediator
  * Memento
  * Observer
  * State
  * Strategy
  * Template Method
  * Visitor

## üóÇÔ∏è UML Diagrams

Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams are an essential part of LLD. They provide a visual representation of the system's design. This repository will include the following types of UML diagrams for each problem:

  * **Class Diagram:** Shows the static structure of the system, including classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.
  * **Sequence Diagram:** Illustrates the interactions between objects in a sequential order.
  * **Use Case Diagram:** Represents the functionality of a system from the user's perspective.

## üìö Most Important Object Oriented Design Interview Questions

This repository will also include solutions to some of the most commonly asked LLD interview questions:

  * Design a Hashmap
  * Design an ATM Machine
  * Design a Library Management System
  * Design an online Coding Platform
  * Design a Car Rental System
  * Design a 2-Player Chess Game
  * Design LRU Cache
  * Design a JSON Parser
  * Design a Vending Machine
  * Design a Food Delivery System
  * Design a Calendar like application
  * Design BlackJack
  * Design a Web Browser
  * Design a Parking Lot
